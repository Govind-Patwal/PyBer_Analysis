# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview 
I recenlty joined as a Data Analyst at ***PyBer***, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion.

My first assigment was to perfom some exploratory analysis on data in some very large CSV files. 

The assignment was for the CEO, ***V. Isualize***, who is a former programmer who started out at MathWorks, a co-founder of PyBer, and is known for being extremely fair yet extremely demanding. Because of her programming expertise, she's particularly insistent that the analytical work be comprehensive and correct.

As a part of this assignment, I will create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling sory about the data. I will uncover the relationship between the type of city (ruban, suburban, rural), and the number of drives and rides as well as the percentage of taotal fares, riders and drivers by type of city.

The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoodd. 

I will write Python scripts using Panda's libraries, the jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib.

## Purpose of this Analysis

In the past I have created various charts for ***V. Isualize***
1) A Bubble chart for the **Average Fare ($)** vs. the **Total Number of Rides** for all 3 city types
2) Box-and-Whisker Plot for **Ride Count** and **Ride Fare** Data for the year 2019 for all 3 city types
3) Pie chart for the **Percentagae of Fares** by all 3 city types
4) Pie chart for the **Percentagae of Rides** by all 3 city types
5) Pie chart for the **Percentagae of Drivers** by all 3 city types

In his assignment, V. Isualize has me (and Omar) a brand-new assignment. I have to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I have to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I have to submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Analysis Steps

## Analysis Results
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.vxnxn
